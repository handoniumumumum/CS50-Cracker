# CS50-Cracker
Cracker for passwords encrypted with classic DES. Assigned through online course Harvard CS50.

If you're taking the course, kindly don't look at this unless you're truly stumped.

The only argument this program takes is a DES-encrypted password.

Passwords up to and including 8 characters have unique encryption. Only the first 8 characters of a password are used in encryption, 
so encrypting Brandons will yield the same as Brandons2 if the same salt is used.
